## Introduction
This is a Computer Graphics project involving the use of OpenGL and C++ programming to create a dynamic 2D simulation of a National Monument scene. The programming assignment encompasses a variety of graphic elements within the scene, such as the national monument, trees with leaves that appear as if they are swaying, moving clouds, a movable buggy car as well as rain. The scene can change from day to night through the graphical user interface, as well as the user controlling the buggy. There is also the effect of falling rain.
